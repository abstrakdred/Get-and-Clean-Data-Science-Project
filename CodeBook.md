The tidy data set was generated from the research data collected for a study on Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset [1].

The new data set contains the Subject ID, Activity label, and all the aggregated means for each mean and standard deviation value from the original raw data sets.

##KEYS

    Subject	      	- identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment: 
				  subject values range from 1 to 30
    Activity	      	- activity label: 
			  (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)


The remaining variables are aggregated values representing the average of each of the mean variables in the raw data set: for each mean there is an aggregated average(mean) for each subject and activity which gives 30 subjects by 6 activity aggregated rows. 

The variables in the tidy data set use the same naming convention as the raw data set, although all the non-alphanumeric characters have been stripped out for the tidy data set:

        f			    - frequency domain signal
        t			    - time domain signal

        BodyAcc		    - Body Acceleration
        GravityAcc		- Gravity Acceleration
        BodyAccJerk		- body Jerk signal
        BodyGyro		    - gyroscope data
        BodyAccMag		- Magnitude
        GravityAccMag	- Gravity Acceleration
        BodyAccJerkMag	- Body Acceleration Jerk Magnitude
        BodyGyroMag		- gyroscope Magnitude
        BodyGyroJerkMag	- gyroscope Jerk Magnitude

        XZY			    - Axial direction, a variable will refer to X, Y, or Z
        mean			    - mean value
        std			    - standard deviation value
        AggMean		    - Average of the mean value


##EXAMPLE

    Subject Activity tBodyAccmeanXAggMean

          1   LAYING            0.2215982
          2   LAYING            0.2813734
          3   LAYING            0.2755169
          4   LAYING            0.2635592
          5   LAYING            0.2783343
          6   LAYING            0.2486565

The sample output above shows the first six subjects for one of the activities, and the associated aggregated variable. Row one shows that the aggregated mean for subject 1 performing the â€˜LAYING activity is 0.2215982.

  Using variable {3}, i.e. tBodyAccmeanXAggMean, from an example above:

   t 		       - the value was extracted from a time domain signal
   BodyAcc	       - body acceleration
   mean	               - mean() was applied to  was a mean value
   X 		       - Axis X
   AggMean	       - aggregated value from a set of raw mean values from a subject and activity
